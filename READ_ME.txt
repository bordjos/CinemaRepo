Greeting to anyone reading this.

This is my Fullstack Cinema Web App that's being developed using Java Spring Boot and ReactJS. 
My main goal is to simulate a cinema Web App that enables users to browse films that are currently being shown and buy tickets for their projections. 
I also plan to implement ADMIN operations such as: adding new films, projections, tickets, deleting them and so on.

The usernames and passwords for the existing users are the same: 'miroslav'(ADMIN) , 'petar' and 'tamara'.

Packages being used (for now):
- axios
- react-router-dom
- tanstack/react-query
- redux react-redux
