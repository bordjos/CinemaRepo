Greeting to anyone reading this.

This is my Fullstack Cinema Web App that's being developed using Java Spring Boot and ReactJS. 

My main goal is to simulate a Cinema Web App that supports both ADMIN and regular USER actions.
- USER actions: making an account, logging in/out, changing the password, browsing available films, buying tickets etc.
- ADMIN actions: adding new films, projections, deleting them, setting and changing the prices for tickets and so on.

The last step is to make the Web App responsive.

Classes used for modelling on the Back End:
- Auditorium (Hall)
- Film
- Genre
- Projection
- ProjectionType(2D, 3D, 4D)
- Seat
- Ticket
- User

The usernames and passwords for the existing users are the same: 'miroslav'(ADMIN) , 'petar' and 'tamara'.

Packages being used (for now):
- axios
- react-router-dom

Plan on adding later on: 
- react-redux
- tanstack/react-query
- millionjs
- tailwind (maybe)
