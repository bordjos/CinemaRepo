Greeting to anyone reading this.

This is my Fullstack Cinema Web App that's being developed using Java Spring Boot and ReactJS. 
My main goal is to simulate a cinema Web App that enables users to browse films that are currently being shown and buy tickets for their projections. 
I also plan to implement ADMIN operations such as: adding new films, projections, deleting them, buying tickets, creating accounts and so on.
The last step is to make the Web App responsive.

The usernames and passwords for the existing users are the same: 'miroslav'(ADMIN) , 'petar' and 'tamara'.

Packages being used (for now):
- axios
- react-router-dom

Plan on adding later on: 
- react-redux
- tanstack/react-query
- millionjs
- tailwind (maybe?)
